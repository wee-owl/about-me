### About myself  
Last year I discovered the field of front-end development. I attend many online courses and webinars. I have been studying this profession at the Netology school  for about six months and at the same time I am improving my qualifications at the RSSchool.  
Frontend is perhaps the most interesting direction, it allows you to develop programming and design skills. With great pleasure I devote all my free time to this.
